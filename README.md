## ‚ú® Overview

KaptureCast is a full-stack, enterprise-grade simulation of a modern Customer Experience (CX) platform. It's designed to showcase a rich, interactive, and data-driven application that mirrors the complex workflows of a real-world customer support hub. From dynamic analytics to AI-powered ticket routing, KaptureCast provides a comprehensive look at how technology can be leveraged to create exceptional customer interactions at scale.

This project goes beyond a simple CRUD application, integrating a generative AI backend to make intelligent decisions, simulating a live environment with real-time notifications, and providing a clean, professional user interface for managing every aspect of the support lifecycle.

| üé´ **Omni-Channel Simulation** | Create and manage support tickets from simulated channels like Email, Chat, and Phone, each with its own dedicated interface.                                         | `Next.js`, `React Hook Form` |
| üë• **Agent Management**       | A complete CRUD interface for managing support agents, including their skills, status, and workload capacity.                                                         | `TypeScript`, `ShadCN UI` |
| üõ∞Ô∏è **Live Status Board**       | A real-time view of all agents, their current status (Online, Busy, Offline), and their active ticket workload, complete with progress bars.                         | `React`, `Tailwind CSS` |
| üîî **Ambient Notifications**   | A global, real-time notification system using toasts to alert users of important events, such as high-priority tickets or agent achievements.                           | `React Hooks`, `Toast`  |
| üîç **Dynamic Search**         | A fully functional, client-side search that allows for real-time filtering of tickets by ID, title, or description.                                                    | `React Hooks`           |

### üß† Intelligent Ticket Routing in Action

The standout feature of KaptureCast is its hybrid routing system. It combines a deterministic **Rules Engine** with a flexible **AI Model** to ensure tickets are handled efficiently.

1.  **Rules Engine Pre-processing**: First, incoming tickets are checked against a set of user-defined `if/then` rules. This handles common, high-priority scenarios instantly.

    *Example Rule:*
    ```
    IF ticket_description CONTAINS "payment failed"
    THEN SET priority = "URGENT"
    ```

2.  **AI-Powered Assignment**: For tickets not handled by the rules, the system sends the ticket details and a list of available agent skills to a generative AI model. The AI then determines the most suitable agent and provides a justification for its choice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack, emphasizing type safety, developer experience, and performance.

-   **Frontend**:
    -   **Framework**: [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) - For server components, optimized routing, and performance.
    -   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For strong typing and improved code quality.
    -   **UI Library**: [React](https://react.dev/) - For building interactive and reusable components.
    -   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
    -   **Components**: [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A beautifully designed, accessible component library.
    -   **State Management**: `React Hooks` & `Context API` - For managing local and global state.
    -   **Data Visualization**: `Recharts` - For creating beautiful and interactive charts.

-   **Backend (AI & Server-Side Logic)**:
    -   **Generative AI**: [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) - A modern AI framework for building production-ready AI-powered features.
    -   **Schema Validation**: `Zod` - For ensuring data integrity between the client and AI model.
    -   **Server Actions**: `Next.js Server Actions` - For secure and efficient form submissions and data mutations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of KaptureCast up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0 or newer)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:
```sh
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd kapturecast
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary npm packages:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses Genkit for its AI capabilities. You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key for the generative model.

```env
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
*You can obtain an API key from a provider that supports generative models.*

### 4. Run the Development Servers

KaptureCast requires two development servers to run concurrently: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI backend.

-   **Start the Next.js Frontend:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the main application, typically available at `http://localhost:9002`.

-   **Start the Genkit AI Backend (in a separate terminal):**
    ```sh
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, which powers the AI routing functionality.

Once both servers are running, you can open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application in action!

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#283046), reflecting the focus on data and reliability, with moderate saturation, will provide a professional appearance
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), almost desaturated of the deep blue hue, offering a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#1EC2B6), is analogous to deep blue and provides good contrast; highlighting interactive elements without overwhelming the user.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clear readability and modern appeal in both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of icons for representing ticket status, priority, and channels.
- Use a clean and structured layout to facilitate easy navigation
- Incorporate subtle animations such as loading spinners
